                    <strong>Client-Side Processing:</strong> The vast majority of our tools operate entirely within your web browser. This means your data never leaves your device. Files you upload, text you enter, and calculations you perform are processed locally on your machine.

                    <strong>No Personal Data Storage:</strong> We do not store, collect, or retain any personal information, files, or content that you process through our tools. Each session is independent, and once you close your browser or navigate away, your data is gone.

                    <strong>AI-Powered Tools:</strong> Some of our AI features (such as the AI Translator, AI Email Writer, and AI Hashtag Generator) require server-side processing. For these tools, your input is temporarily transmitted to our secure servers and immediately processed. We do not log, store, or use this data for any purpose beyond providing you with the requested result.
